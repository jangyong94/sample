### OBJECTIVE ###
I want to build a technical firm which links people who needs technics with specific engineers or scientists in the 
future. Also, I am preparing it by conducting a research, planning several projects, etc. For an example, in the
Creative IT design class, I am planning a business model such as making a smart precedent search engine which helps 
people to predict the probability of winning the lawsuit on the basis of precedents and links them to appropriate lawyers.<br/>
Watching the whole process of running a venture company will help me to achieve my goal and shape up my plans in many ways.
I am certain I will learn many things from it and I will do my best to contibute to the company with passion.
