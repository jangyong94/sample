### OBJECTIVE ###
I want to build a technical firm which links people who needs technics with specific engineers or scientists in the 
future. And I am preparing it by doing a research, planning a smaller business ideas. For an example, I am planning a 
business model such as making a smart precedent search engine which helps people to predict the probability of winning 
the lawsuit on the basis of precedents and links appropriate lawyers in the Creative IT planning class. Working and 
watching the whole process of running a venture company will help me to achieve my goal in many ways. Although I won't

company.
